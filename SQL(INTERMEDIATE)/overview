I’m thrilled to share that I’ve successfully completed an SQL Intermediate course, further advancing my database management and query optimization skills. This journey has deepened my understanding of SQL, empowering me to manage and analyze data more efficiently.

During this course, I explored advanced SQL topics, including:

Complex Joins: Enhanced my ability to work with multiple tables, including inner, outer, and self-joins, to gather comprehensive insights from complex data structures.

Window Functions: Learned how to use ranking, partitioning, and aggregate functions over specified windows of data, enabling more detailed analysis.

Subqueries and CTEs: Mastered the use of subqueries and Common Table Expressions to write cleaner, more readable queries for complex data manipulation.

Advanced Aggregations: Explored advanced aggregation techniques to derive meaningful insights from large datasets and support data-driven decisions.

This course has provided me with valuable techniques that I’m excited to apply in upcoming projects. Thanks to [Platform Name] for offering such an in-depth and practical learning experience!

Looking forward to connecting with other data enthusiasts and applying these skills in real-world data analysis challenges.
