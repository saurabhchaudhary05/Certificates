Iâ€™m excited to announce that I have completed the SQL (Basic) certification from HackerRank! This milestone has deepened my understanding of SQL fundamentals and equipped me with the skills needed to efficiently manage and query databases.

Throughout the certification process, I sharpened my knowledge in key SQL areas, including:

Data Querying: Writing effective SELECT statements to retrieve and filter data, allowing for efficient data exploration.
Data Manipulation: Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to effectively manage data within databases.

This achievement reflects my dedication to expanding my technical toolkit and my commitment to leveraging data for informed decision-making. Many thanks to HackerRank for providing such a valuable platform to learn and validate my SQL skills!

Looking forward to applying these skills in real-world projects and further advancing in data management and analysis. Letâ€™s connect and explore the exciting possibilities within data-driven roles!
